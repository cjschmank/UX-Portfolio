YourTrek was an interactive website and application proposal for Claremont Graduate Universityâ€™s User Experience Strategy and Design (CGU 350UX) course. During this course we had to craft our own individual UX project geared at generating value innovation propositions, establishing provisional personas and  then validating these provisonal personas with in-person interviews that were conducted outside of an REI in Rancho Cucamunga, CA.
