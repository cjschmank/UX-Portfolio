During my doctoral program I have had the honor of working closely on user experience research conducted for Here.LA and Reality Smash, two companies that are interested in eXtended Reality (XR) products and how XR can lend itself to various pain points in urban planning and mental health. 

A lengthy competitive analysis and a highly condensed competitive analysis brief was created for HereLA looking for various architecture and urban planning applications that were currently in the market using any type of XR (i.e., Augmented Reality or Virtual Reality) technology.

Additionally, extensive research on specific use cases concerned with XR and mental health was conducted and a highly condensed competitive analysis breif was created for Reality Smash. Another interesting aspect of this research was that alternative therapies and alternative substance therapy use cases were also researched and explored.
