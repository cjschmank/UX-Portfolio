YourTrek was an interactive website and application proposal for Claremont Graduate Universityâ€™s User Experience Strategy and Design (CGU 350UX) course. During this course we had to create our own UX product for a final project geared towards the generation of a speicif value innovation proposition that solved a hypothesized and validated user problem in the LA county area. 

During a period of custormer discovery provisional personas were established, user interviews were carryied out, and competitive analyses on products currently in the market were completed. Additionally, prior to rapid prototyping wireframes and Mockup Workflows were generated in Figma.
