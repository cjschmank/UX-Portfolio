YourTrek was an interactive website and application proposal for Claremont Graduate Universityâ€™s User Experience Strategy and Design (CGU 350UX) course. During this course we had to craft our own individual UX project geared at generating value innovation propositions and establishing validated user personas by carrying out user interviews. We also spent time learning how to conduct competitive analyses and present competitive analysis briefs.
