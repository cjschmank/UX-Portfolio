Christopher J. Schmank, MA is a doctoral graduate student and user experience researcher at Claremont Graduate University studying under the supervision of Andrew R.A. Conway, PhD. For more information about my academic background see my Academic Website: <a href="https://cjschmank.netlify.app" target="_blank"> CLICK HERE</a>.

Recently, he completed a user experience internship with Hit Point Studios in Los Angeles, CA which led to several consulting positions as a user experience researcher. As a consultant, Christopher has completed competitive analyses and competitive analysis briefs, in-application user experience research, and acted as a writer for in-game NPC responses. What follows is his User Experience portfolio which centers around an interactive website and application that he created called YourTrek--a social networking platform for hikers and outdoor enthusiasts. 

YourTrek was created for Claremont Graduate University's User Experience Strategy and Design. In this course we learned about various strategies used in the UX field to generate rapid, guerilla research for user products. All students generated and validated user personas, conducted competitive analyses and presented the findings in a competitive brief presenetation, and conducted both in-person and online interviews. Additionally, Facebook Ads was used as a means of conducting conversion rate tests, to see if potential users were interested in our novel products. The end result of this course is presented below in the Projects section, we hope you enjoy!
